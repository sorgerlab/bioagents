All Raf kinases are composed of three conserved regions, CR1 (adjacent to the amino terminus), CR2, and CR3 (adjacent to the carboxyl terminus). The regulation of Raf kinase activity is a complex process involving phosphorylation of the regulatory and catalytic domains of the protein and both inter- and intramolecular interactions. The initial process of Raf activation involves the interaction of active GTP-bound Ras with the RBD of Raf and the adjacent zinc-binding cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of CR1, facilitating recruitment of Raf to the cell membrane for activation.78 The role of CR2, which is rich in serine and threonine residues, is less well defined; however, the phosphorylation of moieities within CR2 and various proteinprotein interactions involving CR2 also affect Raf localization and activation.89,119-121 Deletions of the amino-terminal regulatory domains CR1 and CR2, similar to v-Raf, are found in several types of human cancers with activating Raf mutations, suggesting that these domains negatively regulate Raf function. CR3, the catalytic domain of Raf, is also subject to regulation by phosphorylation. Regulation of Raf Kinase Activity General. The overlapping functional aspects of the three Raf isoforms have been elucidated by studies involving Raf knockout mice. In C-Raf knockouts, B-Raf can compensate for the loss of C-Raf in activating MEK in the MAPK pathway, but C-Raf knockouts are much more susceptible to apoptotic stimuli, despite the presence of A-Raf and B-Raf.122 With regard to differences in signaling between the Raf isoforms, A-Raf is a weaker activator of MEK than B-Raf or C-Raf.

    "text" : "124 However, Ras-mediated recruitment of C-Raf to the cell membrane and Src activation are not the only steps involved in the activation of C-Raf. A-Raf, which is structurally similar to C-Raf, is activated in a similar manner; however, the pertinent structural and activational aspects of B-Raf differ from those of A-Raf and C-Raf. Although the structural domains and phosphorylation sites of Raf proteins differ, the greater degree of phosphorylated amino acids in B-Raf confers a 15- to 20- fold higher level of kinase activity in the basal state than either A-Raf or C-Raf, and B-Raf is therefore a much more robust activator of ERK phosphorylation.85,144,145 The differential splicing of B-raf may also account for the distinct kinase activity of the protein. In addition, the structures of several B-Raf mutants mimic the conformational changes unique to phosphorylated wild-type B-Raf, which may explain the ability of B-Raf mutants to activate ERK in the absence of stimulation. Other interactions. In addition to phosphorylation events, the activation status of C-Raf is regulated by protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. As shown in Figure 2, C-Raf interacts with a diverse array of scaffolding proteins (kinase suppressor of Ras and MEK partner-1), adaptor proteins (Bcl-2-associated athanogene-1), chaperone proteins (Hsp90 and Hsp70), substrates (retinoblastoma protein [Rb]), lipids (phosphatidic acid, cholesterol-rich caveolae, and cytosolic lipid rafts), and cellular constituents, many of which, in turn, modulate its kinase activity.95 Activation of Downstream Effectors by Raf Activated Raf principally propagates signaling by phosphorylating the two dual-specificity MAPKKs, MEK1 and MEK2 (also referred to as MKK1 and MKK2; Figs 1 and 2). 75 The Raf isoforms are the best characterized MEK1 and MEK2 activators, and all Raf isoforms activate MEK1, whereas only B-Raf and C-Raf activate MEK2.",

All Raf kinases are composed of three conserved regions, CR1 (adjacent to the amino terminus), CR2, and CR3 (adjacent to the carboxyl terminus). The regulation of Raf kinase activity is a complex process involving phosphorylation of the regulatory and catalytic domains of the protein and both inter- and intramolecular interactions. The initial process of Raf activation involves the interaction of active GTP-bound Ras with the RBD of Raf and the adjacent zinc-binding cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of CR1, facilitating recruitment of Raf to the cell membrane for activation.78 The role of CR2, which is rich in serine and threonine residues, is less well defined; however, the phosphorylation of moieities within CR2 and various proteinprotein interactions involving CR2 also affect Raf localization and activation.89,119-121 Deletions of the amino-terminal regulatory domains CR1 and CR2, similar to v-Raf, are found in several types of human cancers with activating Raf mutations, suggesting that these domains negatively regulate Raf function. CR3, the catalytic domain of Raf, is also subject to regulation by phosphorylation. Regulation of Raf Kinase Activity General. The overlapping functional aspects of the three Raf isoforms have been elucidated by studies involving Raf knockout mice. In C-Raf knockouts, B-Raf can compensate for the loss of C-Raf in activating MEK in the MAPK pathway, but C-Raf knockouts are much more susceptible to apoptotic stimuli, despite the presence of A-Raf and B-Raf.122 With regard to differences in signaling between the Raf isoforms, A-Raf is a weaker activator of MEK than B-Raf or C-Raf. Furthermore, A-Raf can activate MEK1 only, whereas C-Raf activates both MEK1 and MEK2.123-125",

    "text" : "124 However, Ras-mediated recruitment of C-Raf to the cell membrane and Src activation are not the only steps involved in the activation of C-Raf. A-Raf, which is structurally similar to C-Raf, is activated in a similar manner; however, the pertinent structural and activational aspects of B-Raf differ from those of A-Raf and C-Raf. Although the structural domains and phosphorylation sites of Raf proteins differ, the greater degree of phosphorylated amino acids in B-Raf confers a 15- to 20- fold higher level of kinase activity in the basal state than either A-Raf or C-Raf, and B-Raf is therefore a much more robust activator of ERK phosphorylation.85,144,145 The differential splicing of B-raf may also account for the distinct kinase activity of the protein. In addition, the structures of several B-Raf mutants mimic the conformational changes unique to phosphorylated wild-type B-Raf, which may explain the ability of B-Raf mutants to activate ERK in the absence of stimulation. Other interactions. In addition to phosphorylation events, the activation status of C-Raf is regulated by protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. As shown in Figure 2, C-Raf interacts with a diverse array of scaffolding proteins (kinase suppressor of Ras and MEK partner-1), adaptor proteins (Bcl-2-associated athanogene-1), chaperone proteins (Hsp90 and Hsp70), substrates (retinoblastoma protein [Rb]), lipids (phosphatidic acid, cholesterol-rich caveolae, and cytosolic lipid rafts), and cellular constituents, many of which, in turn, modulate its kinase activity.95 Activation of Downstream Effectors by Raf Activated Raf principally propagates signaling by phosphorylating the two dual-specificity MAPKKs, MEK1 and MEK2 (also referred to as MKK1 and MKK2; Figs 1 and 2). 75 The Raf isoforms are the best characterized MEK1 and MEK2 activators, and all Raf isoforms activate MEK1, whereas only B-Raf and C-Raf activate MEK2.",

Once activated Raf-1 can phosphorylate to activate the dual specificity protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2 which in turn phosphorylate to activate the serine/threonine specific protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2. Activated ERKs are pleiotropic effectors of cell physiology and play an important role in the control of gene expression involved in the cell division cycle, apoptosis, cell differentiation and cell migration."

    "v" : "The Structure of Raf The structure of Raf consists of the following: (1) an amino terminus that contains the regulatory domain; (2) an activation loop; and (3) a carboxyl terminus that contains the kinase domain116-118 (Fig 4). All Raf kinases are composed of three conserved regions, CR1 (adjacent to the amino terminus), CR2, and CR3 (adjacent to the carboxyl terminus). The regulation of Raf kinase activity is a complex process involving phosphorylation of the regulatory and catalytic domains of the protein and both inter- and intramolecular interactions. The initial process of Raf activation involves the interaction of active GTP-bound Ras with the RBD of Raf and the adjacent zinc-binding cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of CR1, facilitating recruitment of Raf to the cell membrane for activation.78 The role of CR2, which is rich in serine and threonine residues, is less well defined; however, the phosphorylation of moieities within CR2 and various proteinprotein interactions involving CR2 also affect Raf localization and activation.89,119-121 Deletions of the amino-terminal regulatory domains CR1 and CR2, similar to v-Raf, are found in several types of human cancers with activating Raf mutations, suggesting that these domains negatively regulate Raf function. CR3, the catalytic domain of Raf, is also subject to regulation by phosphorylation. Regulation of Raf Kinase Activity General. The overlapping functional aspects of the three Raf isoforms have been elucidated by studies involving Raf knockout mice. In C-Raf knockouts, B-Raf can compensate for the loss of C-Raf in activating MEK in the MAPK pathway, but C-Raf knockouts are much more susceptible to apoptotic stimuli, despite the presence of A-Raf and B-Raf.122 With regard to differences in signaling between the Raf isoforms, A-Raf is a weaker activator of MEK than B-Raf or C-Raf. Furthermore, A-Raf can activate MEK1 only, whereas C-Raf activates both MEK1 and MEK2.123-125"
